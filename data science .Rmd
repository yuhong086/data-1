## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Understanding Concepts 
1.git is control sysytem which can store and keep track your data and github is a hosting service which is repositories for git 
2,they can not use independently due to the relation , github is service for data or source using git 
3,the storege for data online in the server ,the way we can create the repository in git by 
pwd
cd floder 
pwd
mkdir
cd new floder 
git init

smoker = c('T','F','T','F','F','F')
weight = c(120,137,0,168,91,142)
example_data = data.frame(age,smoker,weight)
weight = c(120,137,0,168,91,142)
weight[which(weight==0)] <-150
